And Iget tearful when Ive downed a drink or two.
Im one of your talking wounded.
Im a hostage. Im maroonded.
But Im in Paris with you.
Yes Im angry at the way Ive been bamboozled
And resentful at the mess Ive been through.
I admit Im on the rebound
And I dont care where are we bound.
Im in Paris with you.
Do you mind if we do not go to the Louvre
If we say sod off to sodding Notre Dame,
If we skip the Champs Elys√©es
And remain here in this sleazy
Old hotel room
Doi'
